# Evens_and_Odds_Simulator
Created on Netbeans 7.1.1, using Java SE 7, this "Evens and Odds" probability simulator is used to generate test data of multiple iterations of a board game called "Evens and Odds".

Evens and Odds:
A board game with arbitrary size N x M holds a token at one of the corners. A coin is tossed to determine whether or not the 
token moves horizontally or vertically. Movement on both axis must bring the token closer to the diagonal corner of the board.
Victory is achieved if the token successfully lands on the opposite diagonal corner of the board, which means that if the token
were to move off the board, the game is lost. 
This can be extended to 2, 3, or 4 players, each attempting to reach their designated opposite diagonal corner. If a piece 
lands on the coordinates of another piece, then the original piece has lost it's place on the board. The last surviving token 
wins.
